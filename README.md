# SpecSheet
   <br>**SpecSheet** is a **`Python_Based Lightweight GUI Application`** that converts `Swagger` / `OpenAPI` Specs into `Excel_Sheets` with Structured API Details and Payloads.<br>
   It provides an **intuitive interface** for `Developers` and `QA Engineers` to **visualize**, **extract** and **document** API endpoints, methods, parameters, and request/response payloads in a Clean **Tabular** format â€”â€” without having to manually traverse **Raw** `JSON / YAML` files.
